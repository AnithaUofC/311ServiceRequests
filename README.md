## CONCLUSION

### Geographical Insights: 
The Downtown community has the largest number of requests, potentially making it a key area for focusing efforts in terms of both service delivery and resource allocation. Communities like 05G show fewer requests, possibly indicating a need to investigate why this is the case — whether it's due to lower demand or a gap in service awareness or it is under development. Road-related services remain in high demand across multiple sectors, while there’s also a critical need for Waste and Water Management Services (WRS), particularly in the Southeast region. This highlights regional disparities and may require more localized resource allocation.


### Service Request Trends: 
Seasonal demand patterns indicate high demand in Summer and Autumn, while there is a slight dip in Spring and decrease in Winter. This suggests that planning and resources should be allocated more heavily during peak months.

### Agency Load: 
Operational Services and Compliance agencies are receiving the most requests, which could imply a higher volume of work or a need for better resource management to handle the influx. Agencies like Fleet and Inventory are managing fewer requests, which might suggest a more balanced workload or a potential area where additional support could be needed for future demand.

### Request Sources: 
Majority of 311 service requests come from email and social media, making it the most used source. Phone and mobile apps follow, showing significant usage. However web requests are minimal indicating a strong preference for other channels.

### Type of Service Requests: 
Roads and Waste and Recycling Services appear as the most frequent service requests, which may suggest that maintaining and upgrading these infrastructures should be prioritized.

### Response Efficiency: 
The average response rate for 311 service requests for the two years 2023 and 2024 is 0.99 which indicates the responsiveness of the system. The requests were handled and closed within an average time of 12.63 days.

The service categories Roads(24 days) and Water Service (20 days) have the longest response times, highlighting potential bottlenecks. Bylaw, CT, and Corporate services also show moderate delays (around 14–16 days). In contrast, WRS, DBBS Inspection, and CBS Inspection are the quickest, averaging under 5 days. Overall, infrastructure-related services face slower responses, while inspections and waste services are more efficient.

The agencies with the least response delays are Elected Officials, Office of the City Auditor,Corporate Wide Service Requests. The agencies with the highest response delays of over 15 days are Operational Services and Compliance, Information Services, Community Services.The first two has improved their response times significantly in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2024, all the closed requests were addressed and handled by the respective agencies under 16 days.

### Trends Over Time: 
It is observed that the number of service requests saw a sharp spike in mid 2023, decline after the peak and there is a small rise by mid 2024, but it is lower than previous peak. A steady delcine after mid 2024 towards early 2025 is also observed. This could be due to seasonal factors, specific events or other time sensitive issues.
